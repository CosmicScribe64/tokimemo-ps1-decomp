# Log

Append-only. Entry format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>` where op is ingest, query, lint, ticket, build, decision, or setup. Use [[wikilinks]] for wiki files and plain paths (e.g. `src/main.c`) for everything else. Recent: `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -5`.

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0007 Ready -> In Progress -> In Review
Wrote CODING_STANDARDS.md (repo root) and linked it from AGENTS.md. Tracks [[tickets/T-0007-write-coding-standards]].

## [2026-10-09] lint | Code review of T-0001 and T-0007
Ran a code review for [[tickets/T-0007-write-coding-standards]] (3 minor findings in CODING_STANDARDS.md/AGENTS.md, fixed) and [[tickets/T-0001-project-scaffolding]] (orphan [[SCHEMA]] page, added to [[index]]). No open findings.

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0001 and T-0007 -> Done
Both moved In Review -> Done on [[kanban]] after clean review. Updated [[index]]; new file CODING_STANDARDS.md.

## [2026-10-09] ingest | Disc findings
Moved `docs-staging/disc-findings.md` to `raw/disc-findings.md` (raw source, unchanged) and wrote [[disc-layout]], [[executable]], [[overlays]], [[toolchain]]; updated [[overview]] and [[index]]. Added `tools/extract_disc.py` for reproducible extraction (verified: `disc/files/SLPM_86.053` sha1 matches `config/SLPM_86.053.sha1`). Tracks [[tickets/T-0002-disc-extraction-and-exe-identification]] and [[tickets/T-0003-docker-toolchain-image]].

## [2026-10-09] decision | Executable layout, bss and segments
Header 0x20/0x24 is the rodata range; text 0x80041000-0x800AF340, rodata to 0x800B3220, data to 0x800E3800, bss 0x800E3800-0x8012B538 (size 0x47D38, from the entry code's bzero). Game code vs SDK libs split at 0x80086810 (heuristic). Config: `config/SLPM_86.053.yaml`. Details in [[executable]] and [[psyq-sdk]]. Tracks [[tickets/T-0004-splat-config-and-split]] and [[tickets/T-0006-identify-psyq-libs-sdk-version]].

## [2026-10-09] build | OK build of SLPM_86.053
`configure.py` + ninja in Docker: splat, as, gcc 2.7.2-psx + maspsx, ld, objcopy; `build/SLPM_86.053.bin` matches the original sha1 with all 831 game functions as `INCLUDE_ASM` in `src/game.c`. Fixes needed: ASCII string encoding (Shift-JIS to UTF-8 changed bytes), linking `build/undefined_syms_auto.txt`. See [[build-system]]. Tracks [[tickets/T-0005-build-system-and-checksum-matching]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0002 to T-0006 -> In Review; T-0008 to T-0011 created
Moved T-0002, T-0003, T-0004, T-0005, T-0006 (Backlog/In Progress -> In Review) on [[kanban]]. Created backlog tickets [[tickets/T-0008-overlay-load-address-and-split]], [[tickets/T-0009-progress-report-script]], [[tickets/T-0010-sdk-lib-object-boundaries]], [[tickets/T-0011-game-code-file-boundaries-and-compiler]]. `.gitignore` now excludes `/asm/`, `/build.ninja`.

## [2026-10-09] lint | Code review of T-0002 to T-0006
Ran a code review against CODING_STANDARDS.md (range 060900b..HEAD). Fixed: `tools/cc.py` (per-stage error checks, INCLUDE_ASM depfile), self-regenerating `build.ninja`, removed `--no-check-sections`, single INCLUDE_ASM macro path in `include/common.h`, `tools/extract_disc.py` (skips Form2 streams, always re-extracts, clean EOF exit), all Python deps and m2c pinned in `tools/Dockerfile` (fresh build verified), [[tickets/T-0006-identify-psyq-libs-sdk-version]] re-scoped. Clean-tree build still OK. Commit granularity finding accepted (later commits are per-topic); trailer follows the task instructions.

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0002 to T-0006 -> Done
Moved [[tickets/T-0002-disc-extraction-and-exe-identification]], [[tickets/T-0003-docker-toolchain-image]], [[tickets/T-0004-splat-config-and-split]], [[tickets/T-0005-build-system-and-checksum-matching]], [[tickets/T-0006-identify-psyq-libs-sdk-version]] In Review -> Done on [[kanban]] after the fixes above. Updated [[index]]. Open: [[tickets/T-0008-overlay-load-address-and-split]], [[tickets/T-0009-progress-report-script]], [[tickets/T-0010-sdk-lib-object-boundaries]], [[tickets/T-0011-game-code-file-boundaries-and-compiler]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0009, T-0011 -> In Progress; T-0012 created
Moved [[tickets/T-0009-progress-report-script]] and [[tickets/T-0011-game-code-file-boundaries-and-compiler]] Backlog -> In Progress on [[kanban]]. T-0011 narrowed to compiler confirmation; file boundaries and Shift-JIS moved to new backlog ticket [[tickets/T-0012-game-file-boundaries-and-shift-jis]].

## [2026-10-09] build | Progress script, funcdiff, ten getters decompiled
Added `tools/progress.py` (+ `ninja progress` target in `configure.py`) and `tools/funcdiff.py` (per-function object diff); `src/game.c` now has 10 getters as C (`include/game.h` holds the externs). sha1 still OK. Documented in [[build-system]]; new pages [[matching-notes]] and [[decompile-workflow]]; [[toolchain]] updated. Tracks [[tickets/T-0009-progress-report-script]] and [[tickets/T-0011-game-code-file-boundaries-and-compiler]].

## [2026-10-09] decision | Compiler not confirmed by gcc
Setters, `x = y`, `x += c` and `&sym` returns do not match with any gcc in `/opt/gcc` (best 4 of 10); original uses `$t6`-first allocation, `$at` store expansion with filled delay slots, `lh`, `or` for move. Details and hypothesis in [[matching-notes]]. gcc 2.7.2-psx kept as the working setup for trivial functions.

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0009, T-0011 -> In Review
Moved [[tickets/T-0009-progress-report-script]] and [[tickets/T-0011-game-code-file-boundaries-and-compiler]] In Progress -> In Review on [[kanban]]; running the code-review gate next.

## [2026-10-09] lint | Code review of T-0009 and T-0011
Ran a code review (medium) on the working tree against CODING_STANDARDS.md. Fixed: `tools/funcdiff.py` (position-independent branch targets, internal labels no longer split functions, dead line), `tools/progress.py` (verifies a C body or INCLUDE_ASM exists, size header required, no dependence on the sha1 check), ticket criteria and comments, `include/game.h` width note, [[build-system]] wording, small commits. New backlog ticket [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0009, T-0011 -> Done
Moved [[tickets/T-0009-progress-report-script]] and [[tickets/T-0011-game-code-file-boundaries-and-compiler]] In Review -> Done on [[kanban]] after review fixes. Created [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]] (Backlog).

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0013 -> In Progress
Moved [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]] Backlog -> In Progress on [[kanban]]; testing IDO (decompals/ido-static-recomp) and other non-gcc candidates against the shelved functions in [[matching-notes]].

## [2026-10-09] decision | Game code is IDO-family; build switched to IDO 5.3
IDO 5.3 with `-EL` (decompals/ido-static-recomp v1.2) reproduces the signatures gcc could not; `src/game.c` now builds with IDO 5.3 through asm-processor (per-file toolchain in `configure.py`, `ido` mode in `tools/cc.py`, guard in `include/include_asm.h`, prelude `include/asmproc_prelude.inc`). 9 more functions match, sha1 OK. Not stock IDO 5.3: non-leaf frames are 16 bytes larger and `func_80042400` has less address CSE. Evidence and hypotheses in [[matching-notes]]; [[toolchain]], [[build-system]], [[decompile-workflow]], [[overview]] updated. Ticket [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0013 -> In Review
Moved [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]] In Progress -> In Review on [[kanban]]; code-review gate next.

## [2026-10-09] lint | Code review of T-0013
Ran a code review (Standards + Spec, since fa2f49e). Fixed the `configure.py` docstring length, reworded the partial acceptance criterion and created [[tickets/T-0014-find-exact-ucode-compiler]] (Backlog) for the frame-size and address-CSE gap. Remaining judgement calls accepted and recorded in [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0013 -> Done, T-0014 created
Moved [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]] In Review -> Done on [[kanban]]; added [[tickets/T-0014-find-exact-ucode-compiler]] to Backlog.

## [2026-10-09] docs | toolchain line updated after T-0013
Updated the stack description in AGENTS.md and CODING_STANDARDS.md to IDO 5.3 for game code, gcc + maspsx for SDK libs, per [[tickets/T-0013-identify-original-compiler-pipeline]] and [[toolchain]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0010 -> In Progress
Moved [[tickets/T-0010-sdk-lib-object-boundaries]] Backlog -> In Progress on [[kanban]].

## [2026-10-09] ingest | PsyQ signature sets (lab313ru/psx_psyq_signatures)
Downloaded the public signature JSONs (no SDK binaries) into the gitignored `tools/psyq_sigs/` and matched them against `disc/files/SLPM_86.053` with `tools/psyq_sigmatch.py` and `tools/psyq_sigfuzzy.py`. Findings in [[psyq-sdk]]: libgte matches PsyQ 3.4 exactly, libc/libcard 3.3, libgpu <= 3.61, libcd/libsnd/libpress newer-looking; game/SDK boundary 0x80086810 confirmed; lib order refined (libgs, libgte, libetc added). Ticket [[tickets/T-0010-sdk-lib-object-boundaries]].

## [2026-10-09] decision | SDK region split into 65 asm segments, 166 real names
`config/SLPM_86.053.yaml` replaces `sdk_libs`/`libapi_stubs` with per-library and per-object asm subsegments; `config/symbol_addrs.txt` names 166 functions. `configure.py` now reads the asm file list from the yaml, `tools/asm.py` assembles text without gas's 16-byte padding (needed for objects whose size is not a multiple of 16), and the yaml sets `generate_asm_macros_files: False` because splat overwrote `include/include_asm.h`. sha1 OK. See [[build-system]], [[executable]].

## [2026-10-09] ticket | T-0300, T-0301, T-0302 created; T-0010 -> In Review
Follow-ups [[tickets/T-0300-sdk-object-split-remaining-libs]], [[tickets/T-0301-sdk-rodata-data-split]], [[tickets/T-0302-sdk-version-conflict]] added to [[kanban]] Backlog. Moved [[tickets/T-0010-sdk-lib-object-boundaries]] In Progress -> In Review; code-review gate next.
